WASHINGTON — In an attempt to silence those who keep insisting he should be the next Republican nominee for president, Speaker Paul D. Ryan will hold an unusually formal news conference Tuesday afternoon to once again rule out his candidacy, an aide to Mr. Ryan said.

Mr. Ryan, who will speak to reporters at the Republican National Committee’s headquarters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, has repeatedly said that he believes the Republican nominee ought to be chosen by Republican primary voters from among the pool of candidates already in the race. But speculation about Mr. Ryan’s intentions has escalated in recent weeks as large segments of the Republican Party are in despair over their two leading candidates.
