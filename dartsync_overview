How the DartSync network works:

When a peer joins the network:

1) peer joins network (use StartClientNetwork)
2) tracker adds new peer to peer table, broadcasts to other peers that there is a new peer
3) peer requests master FS (use SendMasterFSRequest)
4) tracker responds with current master FS
5) peer checks against master table, gets necessary file updates

When a peer updates a file:

1) peer sends a file system update when they update their file system
